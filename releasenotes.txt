Changes for 3.6
-----------------
Changed files:
Nearly every file has changed due to the switch to ADOdb. I won't bother listing all of them.

[ENHANCEMENT] Switched the database abstraction layer to ADOdb. This allows for more efficiency and unlike the previous driver, virtually any type of query is supported, allowing us to combine several queries into one
[ENHANCEMENT] Slightly more useful and better-looking error pages when there's a database error
[ENHANCEMENT] Certain file extensions can be banned from being upload for increased security (see config.php for more details)

[ENHANCEMENT] Added ability to clear e-mail log, no more deleting individually

[ENHANCEMENT] Added ability to recount all categories instead of having to do each individually
[ENHANCEMENT] More options when searching
